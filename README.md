# Django Email Sending Example

This Django project demonstrates how to send emails using Django's built-in email functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python
- Django

You can install Django using pip:
pip install django

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/kibeert/didactic-octo-enigma.email

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd django-email-sending-example

## Configuration

Make sure to configure your email settings in the Django settings file (`settings.py`). You'll need to specify the SMTP server details, email address, and any other relevant settings. Here's an example configuration:

```python
# settings.py

# SMTP Email Settings
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.example.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_email@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_email_password'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'your_email@example.com'
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual email server details.

## Sending Emails

To send emails from your Django application, you can use the send_mail() function provided by Django's django.core.mail module. Here's an example of how to send a simple email:

from django.core.mail import send_mail

send_mail(
    'Subject here',
    'Here is the message.',
    'from@example.com',
    ['to@example.com'],
    fail_silently=False,
)

You can include this code in your Django views, management commands, or other parts of your application where email sending is required.

## Running the Project
To run the Django project, use the following command:
python manage.py runserver
Once the development server is running, you can access the project in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
